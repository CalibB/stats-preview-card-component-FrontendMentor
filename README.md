## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to utilize intrinsic sizing in combination with media queries and relative units to make this design responsive across a variety of screen sizes. It took me a little while to figure out but by going through the MDN documentation I was able to figure it out.

### Continued development

I'd like to improve on responsive design.

### Useful resources

- [MDN CSS Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This contained all the information I needed throughout this project.
